/*
This contract defines a simple poker game in which each player is dealt a hand of 5 cards and the hands are ranked according to the standard rules of poker. The PokerGame contract has a mapping from player addresses to their hands, an array of all the cards in the deck, and an index of the next card to be dealt. The dealHands function can be called to deal initial hands to all players, and the constructor function is used to shuffle the deck and deal the initial hands when the contract is deployed.
